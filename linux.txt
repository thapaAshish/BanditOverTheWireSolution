GREP  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGgTmxXp7xQ


acts as a revision guide to me
--> cat >> file.txt
allows to append data to file.txt
--> cat file1.txt >> file2.txt
concats the contents of file1.txt to file2.txt at end of line


GREP command
g/re/p -> global regular expression print
for searching specific strings or cases matching The regular expression we provide

flags
-P to use regex i learn in regex101 (forgot the name)

-i case insensitive
-w whole word. equivalent of '\b \b'
-n return line number where the regex matched

-A {variable}return contents above the matched case
example : --> grep -A 2 '\d{3}' .
searches for 3 digits all over the file system and wherever the case is matched shows the contents two lines above it
-B {variable} behind
-C {variable} above and behind

useful feature
grep piping
example : listing process involved with chrome

lists all the processes involved with chrome
--> ps -A | grep chome | less
look at it at own pace
